<p><b>Warning:</b> During the F-rounds: Please do not blindly use regular expressions to change A.H. into <code>&lt;sc>A.H.&lt;/sc></code>. That will severely mess up the Arabic transliteration in numerous cases.

<p><b>Now that this work is in P2, please open the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.ph/previews/hughes/DoI.html">preview</a> (warning: 5 MB) in a separate window, and carefully compare the non-Latin text fragments with the result.</b> Please mention any difference you cannot explain (for example due to differences in fonts) in the forum. (I will continue to update this preview regularly.)

<p>This "Dictionary" of Islam is a comprehensive, almost encyclopedic work, explaining a lot of Islamic concepts, and giving a background to its personages and traditions. Written by a missionary active for 20 years in Peshawar, then part of India but today in Pakistan, numerous Christian prejudices shine through this work, but even given that, it is a valuable work, and has been reprinted in Pakistan and India to this day. Not only does it explain a lot of Islamic practices, but it also gives a window on how westerners active in Islamic countries in the nineteenth century looked at them.

<p>This is mostly in Latin script, but most headwords are also given in Arabic script; quite some articles also give a Hebrew equivalent in Hebrew script. This turns this book into quite a challenge for proofers. Since it will be too much work for me to supply all the Arabic and Hebrew during post-processing, I will have to ask the proofreaders to supply the Arabic and Hebrew in transliteration. To make this possible, I've prepared extensive instructions with some examples, <a href="https://gutenberg.ph/previews/transcriptions/transcriptions.html#ch4">which can be found here</a>. Please read those instruction carefully, and keep them open in a separate window (or print them). It will also be very valuable to read the <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/c/tools/project_manager/displayimage.php?project=projectID5879f973ee65b&imagefile=1347.png&showreturnlink=1&preload=next&percent=100&jumpto=1346.png">article on Writing</a> in the dictionary itself (starting page 680). Transliterating all those Arabic words is a big request, so, if you're not familiar with those scripts (or not willing to take some time to absorb their complexities), this project is not for you. Please do not work on this book if you are not willing to deal with the Arabic script.

<p>On the other hand, most pages include only about 20 words in Arabic, and Hebrew is come across only about every few pages, and almost always, a transcription is present; so proofing on this book will give you ample opportunity to improve your Arabic-script reading skills. However, please remember, the transcription used in the source does not map one-on-one to the transliteration scheme used in this project (After every round, I will prepare a preview version, with the transliterated text turned back into Arabic script, for comparison.)

<p>The entries of this dictionary start with the head-word in capital letters, followed by its Arabic equivalent. You will notice that the first line of type is often in a slightly larger size. There is no need to mark this distinction.

<p>The Arabic article, <i>al-, as-, ar-</i>, etc., is shown in front of the head-word, but typed in small-caps, and ignored in the Alphabetical order. During the F-rounds, mark them as small caps (just the article, not the entire word), e.g. <code>&lt;sc>AL&lt;/sc>-[H.]AD[=I]D.</code>

<p>A special challenge is the index. This is sorted following the order of the Arabic alphabet, with the Arabic word on the right, and the English transcription on the left. References (page-numbers) are in-between, but brought to the next line if needed. Please remove the line-breaks, and place the page-numbers after the transcription, but before the Arabic.

<p>For Hebrew, the transliteration scheme is described <a href="https://gutenberg.ph/previews/transcriptions/transcriptions.html#ch3">here</a>, and for the occasional Greek phrase, please keep the accents, following the transliteration given <a href="https://gutenberg.ph/previews/transcriptions/transcriptions.html#ch1">here</a>.

<p>To make the often small diacritics readable, 8-level gray-scale images at 400 DPI have been used, which may be somewhat larger than usual (on average some 120 kB, with some at about 200 kB); these may be slow to download on a low-bandwidth connection.

<p>Feel free to suggest (in wordcheck) words in Latin script (even fragments of words broken by unrecognized notations); but please do not suggest fragments from the transliteration of words in Arabic, Hebrew, or Greek script.

<p>Have fun!
